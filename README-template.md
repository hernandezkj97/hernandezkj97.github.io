## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I have learnt to combine the SVG images with some color, to implement flexbox better, and some UI experience, where the button which highlights more is the more importan, in this case is the button to proceed the order.


### Continued development

Even though I'm good at designing, I want to improve my abilities, I'm keen on designing faster.
