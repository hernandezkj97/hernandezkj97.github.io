A frontend mentor challenge that i took to improve my skills.
I used Adobe Xd to create the color pallete, there was a color provided in the instructions tha was not working at all.

I'm thrilled with my outcome, It took me some time but i managed to finish the challenge.

I have to keep on practicing even more.
